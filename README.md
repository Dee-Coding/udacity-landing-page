# Landing Page Project

## Description

Landing Page Project for Udacity.

## Requirements:

1. Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list.
2. It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.
3. When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.
4. All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.
5. Styling has been added for active states.
6. There are at least 4 sections that have been added to the page.

## APIs & Methods Used

 All the functions and methods that I've used in the project were mentioned in the Udacity Zoom Meeting & slides that the tutor created as a guide to help us through the project. I searched for each function and method on MDN and rewatched, reread the tutorials in the Udacity classroom to know how to use the methods mentioned in the meeting.
